  I’m a full-stack JavaScript developer focused on building practical web applications —
  authentication, APIs, dashboards, and real workflows. I enjoy taking MVP ideas from concept
  to deployment and improving products with clean UI and performance.
</p>

<p className="mb-3 leading-[1.8] text-slate-600">
  I focus on writing maintainable code, breaking problems into small steps, and shipping
  features end-to-end. I’m comfortable working with APIs, handling edge cases, and improving
  existing codebases—not just starting from scratch.
</p>

<p className="leading-[1.8] text-slate-600">
  Currently seeking junior full-stack opportunities (Remote/Canada). I’m open to internships,
  contracts, and startup teams where I can learn fast, contribute meaningfully, and grow as a developer.
